# Job Search Organizer: MySQL (avec Sequelize) and Ionic 3 (avec Angular 4)
## Goal

> While looking for a job, it's cool to have a tool to help to organize everything. We could be able to choose by "**date**", "**town**", "**category**" (per example, "**front-end developer**", "**angular**", etc.), by "**company name**", etc. We could select only companies that not reply (still have hope) and hide companies that sent a negative answer.
