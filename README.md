# All Projects Using SQL as Database

## Projects with ANGULAR (2-5)
> * [Job Search Organizer](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/projects_with_sql/tree/master/angular/job_search_angular2_mysql) : **Angular**, **MySQL**, **Express/Node**
While looking for a job, it's cool to have a tool to help to organize everything. We could be able to choose by "**date**", "**town**", "**category**" (per example, "**front-end developer**", "**angular**", etc.), by "**company name**", etc. We could select only companies that not reply (still have hope) and hide companies that sent a negative answer.

> * [Job Search Organizer](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/projects_with_sql/tree/master/angular/job_search_ionic3): **Ionic 3** (with **Angular 4**), **MySQL**, **Sequelize**, **Express/Node**

## Projects with REACT-REDUX
> * [Job Search Organizer](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/projects_with_sql/tree/master/react-redux/job_search_react_redux_mysql) : **React-redux**, **MySQL**, ***Sequelize***, ***Express/Node***
To build an entire application using 3-tier architecture using **React/Redux** as **UI**, **Sequlize** as ORM (**O**bject-**R**elational **M**apping) and **MySQL** to manage the database. Beside the main features, there are **validations** from the **UI** to the **database**.

> * [(fake) Spotify](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/projects_with_sql/tree/master/react-redux/spotify_react_redux_sql_sequelize) : **React-redux**, **MySQL**, ***Sequelize***, ***Express/Node***
For training purposes, let build a **Spotify-like** application. The **EER** (**E**nhanced **E**ntity-**R**elationship model) could be made without much difficulties, but it will be taken from [**Chegg Study**](http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/design-mysql-database-support-spotify-like-media-cataloguing-application-application-catal-q19651144).
